    <h2>Schnitzel are traditionally served without sauce</h2>
    
    <p>Wiener Schnitzel or vienna schnitzel are usually made from calf; Not pork or beef. 
    You can use pork. This makes for a schnitzel only, not a vienna schnitzel. Both are tasty! (Pork) schnitzel are usually served with sauce and potatoes or frechn fries. The more traditional vienna schnitzel (calf) is thinly sliced and served without sauce, but with cranberries instead.
